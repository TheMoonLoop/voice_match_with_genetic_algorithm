# voice_match_with_genetic_algorithm
Final project for my evolutionary computing class

**From my abstract:**
Speech recognition is a significant challenge in digital signal processing due to the variability introduced by ambient noise, recording conditions, and natural differences in human pronunciation. This paper presents a speech recognition and comparison system based on Genetic Algorithms, which aims to generate a resulting genetic signal that optimally approximates an input speech signal.

The proposed method uses classical genetic operators such as roulette selection, single-point crossover, and inversion mutation, along with a fitness function defined as the square of the similarity between signals. The final comparison between the resulting genetic signal and the input signal is performed using two approaches: a threshold-based method and Euclidean distance.

Experimental results show that the use of Genetic Algorithms improves matching ability in scenarios where direct signal comparison is insufficient. Furthermore, Euclidean distance provides a more robust and consistent measure compared to the threshold-based method, especially in the presence of noise.
